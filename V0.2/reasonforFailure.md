# LFR_using_PID(4 sensor)

We tried to implement a PID in our next version of LFR while also increasing the number the sensors.But the at some point we get to realise that the type of sensor we are using is just a object detection module and it will fails to detect lines. However, the reason why our V0.1 was a success is because we used black tape on while tiles floor, which makes it pretty slick to work on but will fail in any usual surface.

So, we had to drop the idea of upgrading V0. Instead we are planning to build next gen V1 from the scratch.

Stay tuned !
