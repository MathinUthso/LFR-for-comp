# LFR_V0.1

This is a very basic version which uses:
   1.Arduino UNO.
   2.L293D MotorDriver Sheild.
   3.2 DC motor
   4.Object_detection module (You can call it IR sensor module too).
   et all

 The code is very simple. We change the state of the two motors based on detection of line in the IR sensors.
 We have used a threshold to make the thing work as a binary operation such that if detected then ==1 else ==0
